# Anpu’s Feather 阿努比斯的羽毛

## Story

You went on a trip on the Nile river before your death. You’re welcome by Anubis.

Based on Egyptian mythology we ask you to reflect upon your life and offer a token of wisdom (in a shape to be determined as the output). 

Welcome, you have reached the entrance. How have you lived your life? This feather shows the weight of your heart.

## Anpu, Anubis, Protector of the graves
Anubis was commonly depicted in black color, symbolizing the black fertile soil of the Nile River Valley, a sign of life and regeneration [[1](https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=mHD4CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT192)]

## Mꜣꜥt, The Feather of Truth
Anubis uses an ostrich feather to seek Truth, Balance, Order, Harmony, and Justice. Light hearts would ascend, heavy ones be devoured [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat)]
